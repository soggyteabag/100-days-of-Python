Using Replits 100 days of free coding course I'll be sharing some code I have written using their lessons

Concatenate 

print("== My Recipe dish ==")
food = input("Name a food you like: ")
plant = input("Name a plant you like: ")
cooking = input("Name a method of cooking: ")
burned = input("Name a word to describe burnt: ")
item = input("Name an item: ")

print()
print(cooking, food, "with", burned, plant, "on a bed of", item)
